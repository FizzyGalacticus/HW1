*********Assignment Description***********

Get Git set up on the system of your choice. Play with it for a while until you are comfortable with it. Make at least one publicly available Git repository with branching and merging and take a screenshot of a GUI tool showing the project history. Submit a Word document or PDF containing the repository URL and the screenshot, along with description of what tools you used and steps you took.  This should be like a lab notebook, not formal, but something you could easily repeat the process from if/when you need to. I strongly encourage you to do a little investigation on your own. Explore a feature of Git we didn't talk about in class, and write up a post for the discussion board on how to use it, or make a contribution to the Wiki. Or do this part of the assignment with a friend, and see how complicated you can make your branch/merge tree.
